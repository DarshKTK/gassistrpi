All instructions are located at: https://www.darshk.com/tech-tutorials/google-assistant-on-rpi.  You can easily copy and paste the values from my website to your RasPi.  If you have any questions or you encounter any problems, feel free to post them in the DarshKTK Community Forum (https://www.darshk.tk/tech-forum) so that Darsh and other people can give you assistance.
